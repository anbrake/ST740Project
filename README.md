# Prevalence in Childhood Lead Poisoning in Chicago Communities
## ST740 Project

Using Bayesian models, and leveraging the spatial structure of this data, models were made to predict and explain the prevalence of lead within Chicago Communities. Poisson, Beta, Neg Binom regression techniques were used. Variable selection was conducted using the "spike-and-slab" prior method.

Code used for model generation, along with data used is here. The final report pdf is located in the file ST740FinalReport.
