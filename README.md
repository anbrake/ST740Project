# To-do

(Aaron)

rename variables

take out weird or redundant variables (and keep the rates and proportions)

turn the counts into proportions if necessary

fix Gonnorhea male

childhood lead percentages / 100 and multiply by pop count (2 dependent variables) (diff between poisson/negbin vs. beta?)

(Alvin)

make an adjacency matrix of the community areas (Alvin--I have experience working with shape files)




# Model

1) Beta and the Poisson/Negative Binomial

2.1) Adjacency Matrix for the residuals

2.2) Centroid Distances for the residuals

2.3) Spike and slab for spatially varying coefficients 

3) Both Adjacency Matrix for the residuals and Spike and Slab

3) Model Averaging
 
Alvin: Poisson/Negative Binomial, 2.1, 2.2

Aaron: Beta path, 2.3

Deadline: get first two levels of complexity by Thursday early afternoon



Modeling Procedure: 

DIC and WAIC
